The third method of running the application on Expo Snack have implications with the lastest version of Firebase and thus unable to function. Hence, the decision to completely remove features that requires Firebase was made.

The third method of running the application on Expo Snack does not fully work on 'Web' tab as the flat list is not rendering the movie posters. Hence, only by running the application with an Android smartphone with Expo Go is possible to load the application.
